Model Name: Customer Default Risk Model (Proxy PD)
Date: 2025
Owner: Data Scienctist - Leila Barmoudeh

1. Model Overview and Purpose

1.1 Business Objective
The purpose of this model is to estimate the probability of customer default (PD) based on historical transactional and behavioral data. The model is designed to identify customers exhibiting elevated risk of financial loss due to unstable purchasing behavior.
1.2 Business Use Case

This model supports:
Early-warning risk monitoring
Customer risk ranking
Targeted intervention (e.g., review, policy adjustment)

1.3 Out of Scope
The model is not intended for:
Automated credit approval or rejection
Loan pricing or limit assignment
Regulatory capital calculation

2. Intended Use & Scope

Intended users: Risk analysts, data scientists, business stakeholders

Decision support: Advisory only

Deployment context: Batch scoring / portfolio monitoring

Frequency: Periodic (e.g., monthly)

The model provides relative risk ranking, not absolute creditworthiness.

3. Data Description
3.1 Data Source
Historical transactional retail data
Customer-level aggregation derived from order-level records

3.2 Observation Unit
Customer

3.3 Time Coverage
Historical snapshot (single observation per customer)

3.4 Key Variables
Order frequency
Sales volume
Shipping behavior
Customer tenure

3.5 Excluded Data
Personally identifiable information (PII)
Demographic or protected attributes
External credit bureau data

4. Target Definition (Proxy Default)
4.1 Rationale
True payment default data was unavailable. A proxy default definition was constructed using observed loss-related behaviors, a common approach in early-stage credit risk 
and trade-credit modeling.

4.2 Definition

A customer is labeled as default (1) if any of the following conditions are met:
Return rate ≥ 40%, OR
Return rate ≥ 20% AND
Total profit < 0, AND
Average discount ≥ 30%
All other customers are labeled non-default (0).

4.3 Portfolio Bad Rate
5.33%, consistent with typical commercial credit / trade-risk portfolios

4.4 Limitations
Proxy labels may not capture all true default events
Thresholds are heuristic and calibrated for modeling feasibility.

5. Feature Engineering
5.1 Feature Categories

Behavioral: order frequency, shipping delays
Stability: customer tenure
Volume: total orders, total sales

5.2 Leakage Prevention
Variables directly used in the target definition were excluded from modeling, including:
Return rate
Average discount

Total profit
This prevents target imprinting and artificially inflated performance.

6. Model Methodology
6.1 Champion Model
Logistic Regression (regularized)
Transparent
Stable
Governance-friendly

6.2 Challenger Model
XGBoost (tree ensemble)
Captures non-linear interactions
Used for performance comparison only
Interpreted using SHAP

6.3 Class Imbalance Handling
Class weighting applied
No synthetic resampling used

7. Model Performance
7.1 Summary Metrics
Model	                     ROC-AUC	PR-AUC
Logistic Regression       	0.6755	0.3352
XGBoost	                    0.6729	0.3418
7.2 Interpretation

Discrimination is moderate and realistic
Performance aligns with expectations for behavioral proxy PD models
PR-AUC substantially exceeds baseline bad rate (5.33%)

7. Model Performance
7.1 Summary Metrics
Model	ROC-AUC	PR-AUC
Logistic Regression	0.6755	0.3352
XGBoost	0.6729	0.3418
7.2 Interpretation

Discrimination is moderate and realistic. Performance aligns with expectations for behavioral proxy PD models. PR-AUC substantially exceeds baseline bad rate (5.33%)

9. Bias, Fairness and Ethical Considerations
9.1 Sensitive Attributes
No protected or demographic attributes included

9.2 Known Risks
Behavioral proxies may correlate with unobserved socioeconomic factors. Causality is not inferred.

9.3 Mitigations
Model positioned as advisory. Human review recommended for high-risk cases. 

10. Stability, Monitoring & Drift
10.1 Monitoring Metrics
Population Stability Index (PSI) for features. Score PSI for predicted PDs.

10.2 Thresholds
PSI	Interpretation
< 0.10	Stable
0.10 – 0.25	Monitor
> 0.25	Investigate / retrain
10.3 Retraining Triggers
- Sustained score PSI > 0.25
- Material performance degradation
- Significant portfolio composition change

11. Limitations & Risks

- Proxy default labels, not true payment defaults
- No macroeconomic or temporal dynamics
- No causal interpretation
- Performance may degrade outside observed data distribution
- This model should not be used as a sole decision engine.

12. Governance and Ownership

- Model Owner: Data Science
- Review Frequency: Periodic (e.g., quarterly)
- Change Management: Versioned updates with documented rationale

13. Summary Statement

This model demonstrates a production-style probability of default pipeline with appropriate attention to data leakage,
interpretability, monitoring, and governance.
It is suitable for early-warning risk assessment and portfolio monitoring, but not for automated credit decisioning.
