# Customer-Default-Risk-Modeling---Finance-Style-End-to-End-Project
This repository demonstrates a production-style **Probability of Default (PD)** modeling workflow using transactional data and **proxy default labels** (when true repayment/default labels are unavailable). The project is structured to reflect how a bank/fintech would build, validate, interpret, and monitor a risk model.
